Mental Health FAQ Chatbot

This project is a Mental Health FAQ Chatbot powered by a machine learning model using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity to provide relevant answers to user queries about mental health. The chatbot uses a dataset of mental health-related questions and answers to simulate a conversational assistant.

Features:
Natural Language Understanding: Uses TF-IDF to transform user queries and calculate cosine similarity for finding the most relevant answer from a dataset.
Flask Web Application: A simple web interface where users can interact with the chatbot and get answers to their questions.
Typing Animation: The bot's responses are animated, simulating real-time typing like popular AI chatbots.
Pre-trained Model: The TF-IDF vectorizer and matrix are precomputed and saved in .pkl files for efficient performance.
